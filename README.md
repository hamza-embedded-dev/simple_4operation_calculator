Simple Calculator in C

This project is a basic calculator program written in C language. It allows the user to enter two numbers and choose an operator to perform a mathematical operation.

The calculator supports four basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). The program takes inputs from the user through the terminal, processes the operation using a switch-case structure, and prints the result with two decimal precision.

Example usage:

enter the first number:
10
enter the operator (+ - * /):
+
enter the second number:
5
the result is 15.00

To compile the program, use: gcc calculator.c -o calculator
To run it, use: ./calculator

This project is a simple demonstration of user input handling, switch-case control structure, and basic mathematical operations in C.
